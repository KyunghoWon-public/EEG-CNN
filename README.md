# EEG-CNN
Attempts to implement EEG-CNN using tensorflow

The small attempts include the followings:

step1. 2-layer NN

step2. MNIST - CNN

step3. tuning other applications

Goal: tensorflow-based EEG-CNN framework
 1. temporal info.
 2. spatial info.
 3. inter-subject info.
 
Comparison: performance comparision with
 1. LDA
 2. SWLDA
 3. SVM

All the attempts will be added into the repository.
